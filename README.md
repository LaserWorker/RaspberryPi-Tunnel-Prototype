RaspberryPi-Tunnel-Prototype
============================

Using the RaspberryPi to make an encrypted tunnel over the internet. A prototype for a simplified hardware based method for tunneling between two devices.


## Idea

Make a hardware device that can plug and play to eliminate the complications of encryption software installation and use for tunneling connections.


### Long-term Goal

A simple compact Ethernet or USB based device currently identified as a tunnel-builder. 
-The tunnel-builder receives some form of verification by the user before connecting to anything. 
-Upon the verification this tunnel-builder will carry communications over a tunnel to another tunnel-builder, or a device with installed encryption software for communication with the tunnel-builder. 
-The  tunnel-builder can pair with other tunnel-builders by being placed in close proximity or being physically connected to each-other. 
-Once paired a designation for connecting to that specific tunnel-builder will be made available to the user.

These are some of the basic starting points using a Raspberry-Pi.
The inclosed device can now display a number for identifying to the user what tunnel is currently in use.
A button can be used to reset the device and/or change the tunnel currently in use. 
with this initial prototype only ten options are avalible known as tunnel numbers.
The tunnel number designates both encryption type and device ip configured for the specific setting.
